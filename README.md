# 🧭 Maze Solver in Java (DSA Project)

This is a simple **Maze Solver** implemented in Java using **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** principles. The algorithm employs **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to explore all valid paths and identify the shortest route from the start point to the goal.

## 📌 Features

- Implements BFS to solve a static 2D maze
- Directional path representation (`L`, `R`, `U`, `D`)
- Dynamic path validation
- Visual output of the maze with the solution path

## 🧠 Algorithm Used

This project uses **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to traverse a 2D maze represented by a character grid. The algorithm ensures the shortest path to the goal is found by systematically exploring all possible movements from the start.

## 🧱 Maze Representation

The maze is represented by a 2D character array:

- `#` – Wall
- `' '` – Walkable path
- `o` – Goal

## ▶️ How to Run

1. **Compile the code** (if not already compiled):

    ```bash
    javac MazeSolverSimple.java
    ```

2. **Run the program**:

    ```bash
    java MazeSolverSimple
    ```

3. **Output**: The maze with the path from the start to the goal will be printed in the console.
